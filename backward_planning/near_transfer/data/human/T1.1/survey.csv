2,Stayed away from paths that had negatives at the end.,I spent a few bucks to see the the last nodes to see the biggest payout and went that way --- the paths never had big negatives so a +60 was always rewarded in the end.,On a node at the end.,I always clicked through to the end.,,Nothing,The reward was worth the risk.,fun,30

After that I determined that the final node points where the highest priority.

I wouldn't be able to click anymore.,I tried to go around the web and not go towards the place from round to round.,It was hard in the trial phase for me to understand that to discover the value of the nodes you needed to click on nodes where you couldn't move anymore. I spent some time waiting for seconds to pass before I could continue.,"I learned that if the last node was green, I would probably earn money or break even.",I have no other comments.,58.
76,I simply chose my path based on the end node.,I tried to find a terminating node around $50 and worked towards it.,I decided on a fixed pattern and followed it.,When I found an end node at or near $50,"No, it was a simple strategy.",no,How to play a new game.,no,35
77,Tried not to click on the end nodes,Clicking on the end nodes,end nodes,When an end node of more than $40 appeared,get as much info as possible,Nope,"More information, the better",,42

79,I didnt click,I didnt click,I didnt click,I didnt click,"I remembered if the last path was good, and used it until it quit giving rewards, the explored other paths till I found another good one",no,exploration is a good thing. I dont peek,,55
80,Anything not an end node didn't seem to be worth clicking on.,"The end nodes were all I was interested in, since they had the highest values.  I also picked the top end nodes as I seemed to get the best values from those.",End nodes on the top.,If I found a value between 50 to 90ish.,"Basically try not to lose money, though that wasn't always possible.",Nope.  Was very easy to understand.,"That the game was harder than I thought it would be.  Seems simple, but it's a lot harder.  I'm actually surprised I made as much as I did.","Fun game.  Easy to learn, had to master.",36
81,When I saw the negative red numbers.,I decided to click end nodes.,Always at the top.,When I say a high green number.,"No, I just can't remember the correct answers to your quiz.","Yes, the quiz.",To keep practicing until you get the hang of it.,,65
82,"checked destinations first; if larger reward found, didn't keep clicking most of time",random searching,on the outermost nodes,when I identified 'larger' reward,learned not to spend too much clicking intervening nodes,"initially, the choosing highlighted nodes thing was a bit confusing.","Learned to search for target, not spend money on interval nodes",nope,66
83,I decided not to click in the middle nodes because it was costing too much to get to the end result,I clicked the last node of each area to know where the largest amounts were,in the lower left section,I stopped clicking when I found a range around $30 or more,I clicked the last nodes in each area despite it costing $1 each time because I usually regained that money back along the path.,no,It takes a risk to gain a higher reward,,43
84,I didn't click on the beginning steps because they were not worth it.,I clicked at the end points to see the biggest points.,At the end points of each line.,When I found a high score I felt was worth going.,That is all I could think of.,None.,That games are fun.,Thank you and have a great day!,30
85,I did not bother clicking on any circles besides the last step because the values were irrelevant.,I checked the last step circles and looked for the highest value.,I always began my search with one of the last step circles.,When I found a high enough number I stopped clicking and went to it.,I made a mistake on one of the trials and only got a +18 when +45 was available.,Nope,I learned how to play this game.,,36
86,Guessed and avoided areas of low end result,I guessed then went with highest overall,It varied,I guessed based on end value,no,no,Taking chances can be fun,,38
87,I didn't click any intermediate nodes - I knew they were less important than the ending nodes.,I checked the ending nodes for each area - and generally went to a node that had at least $40 in rewards.,Top rows - end nodes.,I stopped clicking when I found a value of at least ~$45-50,,No.,Not much.,,26.
88,I tried to avoid things that seemed negative more often,I just randomly chose,up,When i couldn't go anymore,no,no,Things were not the same,,19
89,"If a group of end nodes all had negative values, there was no need to click around there, since the end pay off would most likely be negative.","I clicked all end nodes to see the end amount you can earn. Then I moved inward from the highest paying end nodes to see if there was any downside to going there, and what the net payoff would be.","For me, was random. Tended to click starting near the left or top side.","When you were left with the best route, you can stop clicking. since the first couple of steps were low payouts or minimal losses, you didn't need to click those.","Since the cap was at $500, I became more loose with my clicking choices, and wanted to see if I was missing any special ""high pay"" nodes hidden between the end nodes.","The beginning ""tutorial"" section which made you wait if you didn't check a certain node was confusing and frustrating.","There wasn't a hard cap at $500. Aside from that, I learned that you can make the ""optimal"" decision without revealing the whole map. ","Interesting experiment, since there was a $ value involved and it felt like a game, I was more inclined to try and had more fun than I anticipated.",23

91,It almost never seemed to make too much of a difference what the values on the way to the endpoints were.,I needed to see on what value did each path end.,On the end of each path.,Once I'd decided what ending got the highest payout.,"No, that's it.",Nope.,I suppose that there must have been a better strategy. I could have made a lot more had I not been so cautious in clicking on every possible end.,,28
92,"Once several negative numbers appeared in the cluster, I did not click on that cluster.","I looked for patterns within the clusters.  My clicks were mainly random, but if I felt drawn to one cluster based on the amount of positive numbers appearing, I would continue to click within that cluster.","I clicked on the bottom half initially, but I think my strategy was fairly random.","I stopped clicking when I reached a number higher than 20.  When I saw a number in the 100s, I realized that there could be higher numbers and felt like I clicked more instead of stopping when I reached a 20+ number.","I felt like things were too random to actually have a strategy.  For instance, when I thought I finally figured out a pattern, I would click and it would change my beliefs.",No,Trying to find a pattern in something is very difficult!,Thank you for allowing me to participate - that was fun!,31
93,the lowest value last step,based largely on where the most valuable last step was,bottom left,when I found a sufficiently high value spot,no,no,how to play the spider game,,35
94,The first nodes and mid nodes.,"I clicked on the last node values, because they were highest values.",The final nodes on each branch.,When I found a high value.,I tried my best to maximize the gains on the final nodes.,No.,How to maximize the profit I earned in the game.,,22
95,I didn't click on dots that wouldn't help me get the highest number at the end.,I checked the last dots where you end the game.,Always an end dot but randomly placed.,"If I found a value around 50, I usually stopped because they didn't get too much higher than that.",I just tried to not click on too many dots to where I would lose money.,No.,I learned the best dots to reveal.,none.,38
96,I didnt see the point of clicking on any node that wasn't a final stop.,"I checked the 5th degree nodes to see what had the highest amounts.  If there was something that seemed good early, then i just went to it to save the money.",One of the end nodes. ,Once I found a 5th degree node that seemed good then I gave up and went to it.  If it was only mediocre then i kept checking. ,Just ignore the smaller inside numbers and find the largest last number with the fewest number of clicks. ,no,"I learned that its not always the best to get all the info, sometimes that costs you more than just making a commitment would be. ","This was super fun, i'd play this as some sort of a mobile app or game if it was developed into a game of some kind. ",32
97,just guessed,just chance ,on the right side,when i hit a relatively high number,"just picked the higher spot
",at first it was,that i did pretty good ,that was fun,46
98,I didn't click on many nodes that were close to the spider. ,"After doing the testing, I clicked on the farthest nodes per the tutorial..",I always clicked on one of the final nodes looking for the highest amount.,I stopped clicking when I reached an amount that I felt was high enough and above a certain threshold.,"I clicked on the farthest nodes looking for anything above 30.  If nothing showed up on the first try, I clicked around again on the farthest nodes of each little block.",It was a pretty straight forward...so no.,That apparently my strategy was quite poor since I didn't even hit the average.,,42
99,Places where I felt I would fail.,Places where I didn't click yet.,Right. ,When I arrived to the end.,Just tried to click in the places where I hadn't click. ,Everything was perfect! ,I learn to play a new game.,Thanks for the survey! ,24

101,I didn't click any inner nodes unless the biggest outer nodes were the same.,I mainly only clicked on the outermost nodes because they were the most swingy.,Anywhere on the outside.,After I clicked all the outer nodes and enough inner ones to makes a guess.,I didn't think the inner nodes were worth it most of the time.,No,I learned how I deal with risks and probability.,None,36

103,If I lost on a not I went to the next one,"I tried to rotate , but honestly could not get a pattern",The left,Till I was unable to move forward,I honestly did not feel I had a strategy but would have loved to play longer.,no really,"Not sure, other than it was a fun challenge",This should be an app game!,55
104,I chose to not click nodes that were in between where I was and a farther away node that had a great cost associated with it.,I chose to click on the farthest nodes from the starting point because they seemed to have the greatest cost or benefit compared to closer nodes.,On the nodes on the farthest edges of the board.,When I found a good path with low cost to a node with great benefit.,I was simply trying to find the best possible benefit for the lowest relative cost to me.,No.,Cost/benefit analysis.,Fun game.,33
105,i usually did not click the first step,i clicked on mostly end nodules,the end nodules,when I found a large enough green number at the end,went the route to the largest end nodule,no,I learned that I there was rarely a route without red numbers,no,60
106,Just gut instinct,Just gut instinct,The lower right,When I got a big number,No.,"No, but this was VERY irritating!  I do not appreciate being made to wait around as some kind of ""punishment"" because I didn't click somewhere.  2 and change for nearly thirty minutes is SLAVE wages!  You should all be ashamed of yourselves!",Nothing,,36
107,If I had clicked boxes in an area and they were all low I would not click over that way any more. ,Where I thought the highest value might be. ,At the top nodes. ,If I was getting mostly negative values I just stopped clicking or when I found one with a high value I would stop. ,Just trying to find the highest value without clicking too many and loosing too much money paying to click. ,I was confused at first that I had to click a node to find at least one value. ,That trying to figure out where the highest value would be was very hard when there was not a pattern established. ,,32
108,"I didn't click on the nodes that were closer to the center because they had less impact, both positive and negative and it wasn't worth wasting money on.",I usually just went to the last nodes and revealed them to see where the high numbers and really low numbers were.,on the end nodes,I usually stopped clicking when I found a really high node on at the end points,not really-- just reveal end nodes until you got a really high one and then proceed walking that way,No-- pretty straightforward,I learned-- at least I think that the highest impact was to go the route of just finding the high point nodes at the end and going for it.,,35
109,Math,Math,equal,Math,Win,Nothing,Winning,,44
110,I only clicked on the end points - left the others alone,I clicked on the end points,I picked different places to start each round.,Either I was done with the end points or I uncovered a big number,No,It was easy,It was a fun game,,57
111,If something wasn't high,I went off of how high the value was of my target,One of the end nodes,When I couldn't click any longer,That sums it up. That was harder than I thought it would be.,No,T take a balance between taking a chance and trying to know everything.,"That was fun :)

Thanks for the opportunity.",32
112,where i would lose money,Random,random,when i came up with a decent positive amount,just the first node with a decent amount is when i stopped clicking,none,that nothing in life is free ,none,27
113,I didn't bother clicking the nodes in the middle of the web because they were low value and I'd have to pass through them to get to the high value nodes,I clicked on the final nodes because I realized they were worth the most,"I tried to make it random, like a computer would","Arbitrarily, when I found a node that seemed high value",That's about it.,It was easy to understand.,I learned to overlook the small gains and losses in favor of the large gains and losses.,None.,38
114,I didnt click on nods within the web ,I clicked at the ends of the web,the sides of the web,When I received a high number node,no ,no,games are fun when money is invovled ,,29
115,I did not click on areas I would have to go regardless.,I clicked at the end nodes that would be my final result.,I would most likely be clicking final destination nodes.,I stopped clicking after I found big numbers at final destination nodes.,I did not click on all nodes in the path.,Nothing was confusing.,I learned how to estimate.,Great and fun HIT!,25
116,Most node leafs whose parent aren't already green.,I just first revealed every leaf node's parent and then I tried revealing the leafs whose parents are already most profitable.,The parent of every leaf node.,Found an adequately profitable path.,Minimum effort exerted.,"While I was moving my browser window to a larger display, I might have skipped the tutorial pages before the first one requiring me to press Space.",UCB has some cool HITs. Thanks for even telling me that my rotated display was not adequate beforehand.,Make more fun HITs like these; tell me more about the study after I'm done.,24
