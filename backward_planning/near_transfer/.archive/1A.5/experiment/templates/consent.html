            <p class="block-text">This HIT is a psychology experiment being conducted by Fred Callaway from Professor Tom Griffiths's Computational Cognitive Science Lab at the University of California, Berkeley. In order to consent to participate, you MUST meet the following criteria:
                <ul>
                    <li>18 years of age or older.</li>
                    <li>Fluent speaker of English.</li>
                    <li>Have not participated in this experiment before. </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p class="block-text">
                 This study is designed to look at how people make decisions. In this task, you will be asked to make choices and answer questions related to those decisions. 
            </p>

            <p class="block-text">
            Your participation in this research is voluntary. You may refrain from answering any questions that make you uncomfortable and may withdraw your participation at any time without penalty by returning the HIT on MTurk and emailing the experimenter at the address provided below. 
            </p>
            <p class="block-text">
            Other than monetary compensation, participating will provide no direct benefits to you. But, we hope that this research will benefit society at large. Many problems that people can solve very easily are very difficult to automate (to have computers solve). By revealing more about how humans learn and think, our research may help others to build and program computers that can solve these kinds of problems. 
            </p>

            <p class="block-text">
            Your MTurk worker ID may be connected to individual responses, but we will not be asking for any additional personally identifying information, and we will handle responses as confidentially as possible. We cannot however guarantee the confidentiality of information transmitted over the Internet. We will be keeping data collected as part of this experiment indefinitely.
            </p>
