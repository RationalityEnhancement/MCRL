<p>This experiment has two stages which you will complete in separate HITs.
The total base payment for both HITs is $2.00.</p>

<p>Stage 1 takes about 5 minutes. Its base pay is only $0.20. But you will also earn a $0.55 bonus and it makes you eligible
to participate in Stage 2 where you can earn $1.90 in 10 minutes plus a performance-dependent
bonus of up to $3.50 ($1.30 is a typical bonus). 
You will complete Stage 2 in a second HIT which you can begin <b>tomorrow
between 1:54 PM
and 1:54 AM</b>.
If you do not begin the HIT within this time frame, you lose the bonus from Stage 1 and will miss out on the
much more lucrative second part of this experiment.           </p>

<p>By completing both stages, you can make up to
$5.50, but if you don't complete Stage 2, you will lose your bonus from Stage 1 and the HIT would be a very bad deal for you.</p>

<p>This experiment has two stages which you will complete in separate HITs.
The total base payment for both HITs is $2.00.</p>

<p>Stage 1 takes about 5 minutes. Its base pay is only $0.20. But you will also earn a $0.55 bonus and it makes you eligible
to participate in Stage 2 where you can earn $1.90 in 10 minutes plus a performance-dependent
bonus of up to $3.50 ($1.30 is a typical bonus). 
You will complete Stage 2 in a second HIT which you can begin <b>tomorrow
between 1:25 PM
and 1:25 AM</b>.
If you do not begin the HIT within this time frame, you lose the bonus from Stage 1 and will miss out on the
much more lucrative second part of this experiment.           </p>

<p>By completing both stages, you can make up to
$5.50, but if you don't complete Stage 2, you will lose your bonus from Stage 1 and the HIT would be a very bad deal for you.</p>
