1,"I pretty much only decided on where TO click, starting with the outer nodes and working my way in logically. I pretty much never clicked the nodes closest to the start",I worked on the outer nodes first and tried to use luck and logic to find the positive 48 quickly,outside nodes that were different than where I had gone before,When I found a logical clear path,tried to figure everything out in as few clicks as possible,no,Game theory in action,thanks!,31
2,Seeing too many negatives,completely random unless I saw a negative in one line,the end of the lines,When I saw a positive 24 or 48 ,"I tried clicking nodes, then tried a few rounds without clicking to see how well I could guess. I lost the most that way, so went back to chancing -$1 instead of -$48","The test was hard, as there seemed to be no rhyme or reason to which node you were expected to try before moving the spider",I am a horrible guesser!,Fun game!,51
3,In the most closest nodes.,Always find the highest values in the out most nodes.,In the nodes beside the center.,when I find 48 in the out most nodes.,No I don't have any. It was a fun game.,No.,After practice we change our strategies.,,33
4,lowest possible payout,based on highest possible payout,-24,when i reached the maximum amount,try to earn an average of $50 per round,"at first, i must've mis read the instructions",be decisive,none,33

Then I stop clicking and go to that node.,"I always started clicking on the leaf nodes to the left, but there's no real reason I made this choice.","When I discover a leaf node with $48 value, I stop clicking and go to that node.","No - just keep uncovering leaf nodes until I find one with a $48 value. Then I go to that node. That was my entire strategy. This strategy might not be strictly optimized (?), but it works as a decent heuristic approach.",No - this was a very fun HIT! Very well-constructed. Much more intriguing than most MTurk surveys. ,Um...always go to the first leaf node you discover with a $48 value.,"Thanks for the survey! It was a lot of fun, and very well-constructed. You know, by MTurk survey standards. I'd still rather watch Netflix though. And you guys pay really well.",25
6,It didnt matter to click closer to me because I had to go through those anyway to get to the last ones,I learned quickly to click father out to find the ones with +48,The last ones,When I found the 48 by clicking on it or due process of elimination,not really,No,I learned to check for the outer ones first,,23
7,i decided not to click on the negative numbers.,i wanted to look at the end totals to decide where to go.,top left node,i stopped clicking when i found a positive 48 or if i couldn't find a positive 48 then i settled for a positive 24.,i worked left to right for the most part to find the best positive number.,no,i learned to check a lot of options before deciding what to choose.,interesting and fun survey!,41

",if It was 24 or 48 that was the best I could get. ,"It was frustrating at first, but I slowly got the hang of it. ",The beginning was confusing. ,I learned that you have to spend money to make money. ,,26
13,When you hit on a negative result respond by acting as though the negative was moving clockwise.,Figured there was some kind of pattern to it. I ended up with negative 48 at the end the figure would then move to the opposite side. ,To the right.,When you got to the end.,No it was all just trying to figure out yours. ,Trying to figure out which way the numbers were moving,"To not over think things, the game was based on luck",N/A,61

15,Did not want the negative values,I tried to get the most money ,the ends ,when I starting losing too much money,I tried to uncover the space with 48 but did not do it beyond 4 clicks in order to not waste money,no,I probably clicked too many points,,29
16,I chose to click in groups to have to most outcome,I clicked the last nodes randomly,The last nodes on the left or right,When I found a path that offered a good amount of money,,No,Sometimes its better to take less risk and do something safe,,20
17,i just went with my instinct,I took turn up left ad right,it changed,the arrows wouldnt let me go anymore,no I went with my instinct ,no,nothing,,35

Clicked on ending nodes first. ,last nodes you could move to because they had the highest values,Once I figured that I thought I had the best choice. ,,no,I was actually more into playing the game than earning the bonus. ,,36
19,I tried not to click in the middle because this might not tell me how much value the path had overall,I mostly clicked the last circles in each path to reveal higher amounts. The last circle seemed to reveal the highest positive amount and highest negative amount.,I liked to click the last circle of different paths because they seemed to have higher positive amounts and higher negative amounts.,I stopped clicking when I reached the end of path.,I tried to click on the last circle because this seemed to reveal the higher positive amounts and higher negative amounts. If I clicked on a last circle with a certain path with a higher positive amount I would follow this path.,Nothing confusing or hard to understand.,I learned to take the knowledge I learned earlier to help me later.,Very interesting,46
20,I didn't go for any of the inner nodes as the pattern was that they had immaterial values compared to the outer ones. ,"Always starting with the outer nodes, but no logic as to which specific ones.",Any of the outer nodes. Maybe there was a pattern to them across rounds; I didn't pay attention closely enough to remember.,If I discovered a 48 I would stop and go straight to it. Otherwise I would click all outer nodes and then go to a path to a 24.,"I always revealed outer nodes until I either saw a +48 or had uncovered all of them. I didn't do the expected value calculations, but my gut told me that only $1 per node, it was worth it to spend every round for the chance of discovering a 48 (it seemed that a 48 was at least every other round).",No.,"You have to spend money to make money, but I already knew that.",None - fun game. ,31
21,guess,guess,yes,when i found 48,no,no,to find the best node,none,32
22,The first node wasn't worth very much so I barely would click on it.,"I learned that the last nodes is where the real money is, and there was typically only one $48 node. I clicked on the outer nodes until I found the highest, or what I could presume was the highest in that set.",At a random last node.,"If I was reasonably assured I would at least get $48 or $24 dollars at the end, regardless of any minuses I would incur in the first two nodes.",,No,I learned to check the outer nodes first. The practice set really helped to establish this method.,,23
23,"Whenever the end node was a negative number, I did not bother clicking around that area. I followed the green.","I decided where to click by centering around any $48 I found. If I found one or two, then I'd see which had any negatives around it.","I was most likely to click on an end node in any direction (top, left, right).","I decided when I found a $48 next to another green, positive number. I didn't need to know every node - just the one that had the $48.",Nothing else. I just followed the biggest green and avoided exploring the red.,Nothing was confusing.,I learned to prioritize. Prioritize my energy and resources towards the biggest prize and ignoring the rest.,Very fun game. It was enjoyable playing.,26
24,I did not click on any of the interior nodes unless they were a turning point,I clicked the end nodes since they had the highest payout,I did every round,"If I got a +48, I would usually stop since you would get a positive payout",I just looked for the highest end payout and the clicked over to it,No,Nothing really,No,52

29,,,,,,,,,
30,the first step nodes does not matter,check on the last step nodes,the last step nodes,when I see +48 on the last step node,the +48 nodes seems to go in a pattern but later the pattern change,none,always check on the last step nodes,,23
31,Based on where maximum payoff was on the previous try. Chances were it would not be there again.,Last node of every path - where payoff is the maximum. Then follow path to it.,Where max payoff was not in the previous round (or the one before that),When I had a reasonable idea where the maximum payoff ($48) was based on the value at other nodes,Look for the $48 (last) node and follow path to it. The $48 would more than pay for the cost of clicking more than one node.,No,"As always, good strategy is everything.",ComMents,54
32,I went with my gut on this as well. I was not very successful,I did use some dollars in the beginning but then i just tried to go with m gut. ,i most likely went up instead of to the sides,"I could only click when i am on the first node so once i got pass that, i went with my gut",There really was not too much to my strategy. I just did what i felt was going to be right. But was not very successful,no,To always use the help. I should have kept using the clicking. also you never know what number is going to show up ,,31
33,I guessed,I guessed.,anywhere.,when I found a green high number,I guessed on everything.,no,I'm sure I learned something but I don't know what.,,48

36,"Guessing, Instinct",Randomly,right,I never did click because I did not want to use up a dollar,"no, I just was testing out what move would be best",no nothing was too hard to understand,never trust my instinct. I should click before moving,seems like there were more negative values in the later rounds,27
37,Based on what the last notes provides and what journey is provides the best result.,At first I clicked all the last nodes and from there I decided where to go next.,The lower end node on the left.,When I found the node with the highest result.,I used the $1 fee to open all ending nodes to see which one has the most points and then I go from there. ,No,I learned to be resourceful and to use as less money as possible.,Thank you!,28
38,I quit clicking if I found a 48 because that is the highest possible number and I would not click nodes that had a positive number next to them because most of them time it was a negative number next to it,I clicked the nodes on the outer edges until I found a 48 or I revealed all of the nodes and if I found a 24 then I would click the first nodes to see what path to follow,The outer edges of the paths,When I hit the 48 or when I revealed the path to the best 24,I used what I learned in the training.,No,To check the nodes on the outside first to find the end of the path.,Thanks.,25
39,I didn't waste my clicks on the 4 or 8 nodes,I clicked on the nodes that I new were the highest value,right side top,when I found a positive value in the largest category,,no,I started to learn the patterns fairly quickly,no,36
40,"Again, based off of the previous rounds, there seemed to be a pattern of where the negative nodes were.",I was basing my clicks on the patterns that I had noticed in the previous rounds.,The node right above the starting one.,When I had figured out what type of path I was going to take.,,No.,I learned that there are definitely patterns to be studied that can help you in a game like this.,,28
41,"Just when I found a 48, I usually stopped",I started with a random end each time,I think the bottom left,"when I found a 48, usually","really wasn't one, ",no,not sure,no,42
42,Randomly,Randomly,Where the high amount was in the last round,Once I uncovered the 48,Didn't really have a strategy,In the practice rounds it seemed like the time you had to wait was not based on anything I was actually doing. ,The best way to make the most money in the game,None,42
43,Eventually I realized that if one of the two outside values was 48 I didn't need to click the other on that path because the variable was the two immediate steps before it.,outside spots were the biggest value.  If there were two outside spots valued at 48 then I checked which path gave more,lower left corner,When I knew the most valuable path,it only evolved slightly after the training rounds.  I figured out 90% of my strategy in the training.,No,To think through the hypothesis.  It was also so worth getting a preview since the click only cost $1.00.  Gambling in these parameters didn't make much sense.,thanks!!,38
44,I tried not to go for lower than 48,I tried to go for the 48.,On the outer edges.,When I saw a path to the 48 or the 24 that was clear.,It was a game of chance.,No,I learned that it was hard not to sacrifice money to try to make money.,Interesting and fun.,57
45,I learned quickly that the first two steps don't matter.,I tried to find the highest ending value with the least amount of clicks.,The terminus of the top left route.,I decided when I found the maximum final reward.,"The order of the clicks was a random guess, the the training taught me that a high final payout could erase any penalties from the first two steps.","No, it was not.",I learned that it was best to sacrifice some cash in order to maximize the reward.,Good luck with your research!,41
46,I didn't click on the inside nodes because the training said to click on the outside highlighted nodes.,"I decided to click on the highlighted nodes at the end to see which would be the biggest number. Once I saw a +48, i went that way. ",the top and bottom nodes of each maze,as soon as I found the highest + number like +48 or +24,I was trying ti maximize my earnings by finding the highest positive value node I could end on. ,At first it was hard to know which nodes to click on and how many dollars I wanted to spend. ,I learned that I had to spend money to find the best path. The only time i ended up losing money was when i didn't click on nodes at all and just picked a path. ,"Thanks, this was fun and interesting!",34
47,If I found a +48 I didn't click anymore.,I just saw where the +48 was and followed that.,Outside boxes.,When I found a +48.,I just clicked the outside boxes until I found a +48.,Nope.,How consistent each round is.,no,29
48,tried not to start where I last ended up,random,random spots,when I would find the positive 48 or highest positive outcome.,it was fun :),nope,Not exactly sure what this survey was about. but it was fun,,28
49,guess work,just guess work,right arrow,came to end,tried same thing few times hoping to earn more,no,guess work does not work much,nothing,37
50,If the information available was enough to make a decision,"Randomly, usually starting on the left",Left nodes,If the information available was enough to make a decision,,No,Left nodes were usually better,,32
51,"If I clicked an outer node that was +/-24, I avoided clicking its opposite to save $1 and tried a different pair of outer nodes in search of a +48","I clicked an outer node first since it had the min or max point value. If the min or max was +/-24, I tried a different outer node till I found 48",I think I clicked the top outer nodes first most often.,"If I found a +48, I stopped clicking inner nodes because the path would always be positive in my favor by a lot","Once I found a +48, I stopped clicking and moved the spider. I never moved to an outer node if I wasn't sure of its value since $1 was a cheap way to avoid  a -24 or a -48",In the practice round I was confused about the hints it gave me regarding whether or not to stop clicking. It didn't seem to make sense.,Spend the $1 on node insurance,fun game. Thanks!,42
52,I didn't click any of the interim nodes.,I only factored in the final nodes and the cost of clicking.,the end nodes.,When I'd find the 48 dollar value.,I think I summed it all up above!,"In the beginning I kept getting an error telling me I was clicking the incorrect nodes. I thought I'd read the instructions, but it's possible I missed something.",Small sacrifices are worth the large payoff.,Nope!,27
53,using the previous stage,By thinking of the last level in the game, click most in the left side at beginning,decide by thinking about the steps and point i earn,I think this strategy of this game is about making the decision what to do next ,"Yes, i was confused a little when choosing which side i should go",I learn something about the decision making,No comments,28
54,The values of the final destinaion,The final destination,The final destinations,When i found the highest value,Once found the highest final destination would expose the route.,No,The most direct path can be not the most rewarding,none,28
55,When a path wouldn't lead to a high last number,"I chose based on what would get me to the highest end value I could find, because it would be the greatest net gain once I found a positive 48","I would always start with the ending points, because those showed where the highest net value would be",I would always stop clicking once I found the positive 48 (or the next highest number).,"I always clicked to show values, because it wasn't worth a risk to get a -48 on a round rather than just spending $1 to see what it was. ","No, the instructions were great and it was very straightforward.",It was worth it to spend a small amount to find out where your highest potential gain was. ,Interesting and fun HIT!,25
56,When I was able to find the $48 first,I tried to click the ends since that is where the $48 would appear,the ends,When I found the $48 i just moved the spider in that direction,,No,To pay attention to patterns,no,25
57,Didnt waste on the closer nodes,I picked the end nodes,Randomly on the ends,When I got a high number,"Just the ends, and not in the same spot as last time",Nope. Everything was easy,I learned how to get to the best outcome,Interesting and fun study,35
58,I finally figured this out during the training.  You have to click the nodes at the top first.  Then if they are less than 48 you can check  other nodes.,I clicked the nodes on the top ,The top right node,If the value the first node was 48 I would stop clicking if not then I would keep checking until I found one that was 48,"I just basically tried to click until I found a node value of 48, and then went towards that since it is the highest value.","At first it was hard to understand the game, so I did horrible.  The training helped me to finally understand how to play.","I learned which nodes I needed to click on without losing money.  I figured out you stopped when you found 48, and you could keep checking until you hit 48.",This was a really fun HIT.  I enjoyed playing this game.,41
59,I'd avoid the 2 directional ones and just focus on the branched ones.  If I found a +48 I'd stop clicking,I just figured I should keep a consistant patttern and started in the bottom right until I found a +48,Always started at the branch of the bottom right,If I found a +48 or the was done clicking the branch ones.,Just wanted to be consistent and figured averaged out would be better than trying to gamble on where to start clicking.,Could have explained in the tutorial you wanted us to click certain ones I just started going at it and got a timeout for a bit that was annoying.,I learned a bit about how this game works.,,25
60,I did not want to click on the first and second nodes because those values are too small to greatly affect the payoff.,Since the ending nodes had the bigger losses and rewards I wanted to reveal them. ,The last node. I did not have a preference for which last node to pick.,"When I saw the highest value you can get, 48 then I decided to take the move. I did not want to waste more dollars.",,No.,Not much.,,24
61,If there was a big negative amount.,Tried to unveil the $48 slot and go from there. ,Nowhere in particular.,Stopped at the last spot where the $48 was or $24.,"My strategy was very random, dependent on the unveiling.",No.,How to use more strategy over time.,Thanks.,31
62,when i used the reveal nodes i tried avoiding going any direction that started negatively,tried to click where i felt like i could make money,wherever the highest value green was,i didnt stop i kept hoping for the best,i didnt really have a strategy other than going where i felt like i could make the most. i failed miserably tho,no,not to press my luck,no,37
63,The first steps didn't matter too much because it was such a small loss or win.,I was mainly interested in the last step because that resulted in a higher loss or payoff.,At the last nodes.,When I have found the $48 reward or $24 if there was no $48.,N/A,N/A,N/A,,28
64,I didnt click the middle ones,The end ones were the most value,The last button,When I found the highest number,No,No,Nothing,No,35

66,eventually learned clicking on the first ones wasn't worth,Since you could only go one way and the first node was always less eventually I would just click on the one farthest out,the first ones,once I had a good feeling about where to,the $1 clicks were worth getting more,no,that it was actually pretty easy- but it took me awhile,fun!!!,38
67,I tried to avoid the red ones at first,I don't know,the left bubble,Whenever there was a green number,At the end I stopped using the hints because I was doing bad no matter what and I didn't want to waste the dollar,no,I learned that even if a node branch started green it would not end green ,,33
68,I didn't waste clicks on the low scoring ones.,I clicked on the final step because they either gave or took the most,The final step.,Once I found the $48,I clicked until I found the $48 and went in that direction,The question asking how much the range for the first step was. I didn't know if it was referring to the very first step you make in the spider game or to the first step of the survey (the practice round).,To go for the bigger prize,,23
69,I lost a lot of money just checking the first nodes,I realized it was worth my while to check the furthest out nodes because I wanted to guarantee I'd come out ahead,The outer node on the right,"If I found a green 48, or checked 1 out of each of the 3 outer nodes",That about sums it up. Try to find the green 48 with the least amount of clicks,"No, it was very clear, it just took a few rounds to come up with a strategy",Nothing?,Thank you for the opportunity to participate!

Maybe next time allow us to go backwards and change our moves for a fee instead of revealing the value of a nodule,30

86,The first couple of nodes didn't really matter,The last nodes were the most important,The last nodes,When I saw a 48,none,none,Finding optimum strategy,,28
87,It was random.,I randomly clicked the last nodes until one revealed the highest amount.,It was any random last node.,I stopped if one revealed a green $48,There wasn't much of a strategy. I followed the training session tips.,No,To not be too greedy exploring all the nodes as that would cost more.,No,31
88,When there were too many negative factors.,"It took me awhile to catch on. I clicked the ends first to see what had the best option. If a green 48 popped up, then I knew to possibly click other bubbles to see how to get there.",On an outside corner.,When I saw a green 48.,"Clicking to see the highest green number, if I got a 48 on the first try, then click others around to see if I could get there without losing all the money. ","I was confused at first during the trial run, because I felt like no matter what I clicked on I was doing something wrong. I misunderstood at the beginning and thought you could only click on one bubble for the entire round, but I figured this out later and then I understood a lot better. ",To be a little more patient when learning the trial round. ,,35
89,Anything other than the last node was irrelevant.,I clicked at the last circle on the line to find the 48,Bottom right-most circle.,"As soon as I found a 48, I would stop clicking.","I would usually click the last circles of each line until I found a 48.  As soon as that happened, I would send the spider along that path.  It was always better to click on the last circles to make sure you didn't land on a big negative space.",No,I learned a quick and easy game about making choices based off of a quick cost analysis.,Fun activity.  Thanks.,33
90,I knew not to click on the inner circles because they were not worth that much.,I found it best to click on the circles on the outside because they were worth the most money.,I tried to click on an outer circle that had the highest dollar amount the most times.,I stopped clicking once I found a circle with the highest known dollar amount on it.,I followed my gutt instinct.,Not at all,I learned that you can guess correctly more times if you try and focus on the odds of where the good dollar amounts appeared most of the time.,simple and straightforward,34
91,I decided not to click on the lesser valued nodes.,I checked the corners first because I learned that they had the highest amounts. From there it was random.,I think the top left corner.,When the amount I was looking for was found or the next best.,Only tried to make the most.,"At first I misunderstood why I had to wait all those seconds even after I read the message that came with it, but it was not confusion, but lack of understanding initially.",I learned to checked the corners first and only because that's where the highest amounts were and they mattered the most.,Very nice game and a great change of pace from the usual.,36
92,i didnt it was random,just random choice,to the right,at the last step,"no, it was random",no,nothing,no comments,44
93,Where the negative number was at the end.,"I tried to see if there was a pattern sometimes, but that wasn't always true.",In the corners.,When I had an idea that the end number would be positive.,No.,No.,How to create a strategy to earn money.,No.,39
94,Avoid the negative last stage. ,I eventually looked for 48s and beelined toward them. ,The last stage. ,Stopped looking at near tiles when the game became clear to me. ,"Confused at first, then looking for 48s.",No. ,Go for 48s. ,,37
95,"The first steps wouldnt be very valuable to click, since it wouldnt help with what the final node would be.",I tried to find the ending nodes with 48.00,The final nodes,"Once I found 48 I would stop. If I clicked a few without finding 48, I would go towards the highest",I didnt get a strategy until after a few rounds,No,The end result is most valuable,no,30
96,"If both legs on the outter-most were negative, that path was a dud so you ignore it.",Check the outter-most first to find a 48 or highest positive value.,Bottom right,When you find the highest positive value.,"If you find a 48, just go for it otherwise you're losing money with each click. I messed up one round and thought the path lead to a positive but I had mis-remembered and was rushing. Outside of that instance, this was my strategy.",Negative.,Not specific to the game: double check your path. Specific to the game: the best route will usually end with the highest available reward so take it once you've found it.,Very interesting. Thank you for the opportunity!,35
97,I didn't click on the first or second steps.,I clicked on the end steps and did so randomly.,The end step on the left or right side.,I stopped clicking once I found 48 because that was the highest amount.,There's not much else.,It was confusing at first knowing which one to click.,I learned how to use it correctly.,,23
98,I just clicked randomly,I just started clicking randomly as the game went on.,Random,When the round was over?,No,No,Nothing,,31
99,"If large sum was already determined, clicking inner nodes was inconsequential",Outside first to determine where large sum was,outer node on bottom right,when best large sum was discovered,I  was consistent in my starting location.,no,unsure,no,32
100,I never clicked an inner node,I just picked the firsst one at random and then went clockwise,The outermost node at the upper left,when I found the +48,"find the 48, go from there",no,How to play the same,,37
101,,,,,,,,,
102,,,,,,no,nothing,,30
103,didn't bother with the small amounts.,looked for the 48,at the ends,When I found the 48,That sums it up,No it was clear,That finding the good end nodes cost a bit,"The game claimed to be able to pay out up to 5$ bonus, I don't see how this is possible considering the amount of trials and point values.",28
104,"I went in order, so I didn't click if I already found a satisfactory route, hopefully with +48 at end.",I just clicked close to the spider first to see one route through.,Near the spider.,I stopped clicking when I found a route with +48 at the end.,"I checked out a whole route first, left, right, or top. In retrospect I should have checked the last nodes first.",No,I learned to check the final destination first before going through.,,26
105,negative number,where the end is,top node,if a path looks good,path that ends in a positive integer,no,lower number sometimes netted more,NA,20
106,front values were always lower,the bigger end points,bottom right,once green,try to go for higher,no,go with positive value ,none,26
107,I did not click when the path seemed to be red or negative. ,I clicked wherever the path seemed to be green. ,"Most likely to click going up ladder, or wherever first green box was located. ","I stopped clicking, once money was calculated. ","I tried to follow a path, wherever the green squares would lead me. ",Easy to understand,I learned to stay with my pattern. ,,52
108,Follow the arrows if there is no arrows then you can't go ,I just followed the arrows,either to the left or right or up or down ,when there is no more arrows ,No ,no ,Which direction to go ,,39
109,I didn't click on nodes if the two last nodes were both negative or lower value.,I clicked on the last nodes to find the one with the highest value and then narrowed down if there two or more were the same.,"One of the last nodes, I just chose randomly.",When I found one at $48,If I found a $48 node I just went there without much further investigation because that would have cost $1 per node.,No,How to balance spending with earning.,,28
110,"when i was clicking the final nodes to reveal, i tried t do one on each path first- so i didnt click the one on a path that i did click","first clicks i choose randomly, but towards the end if i found the positive 48 then i just went for it.",top path- right node,when i found the positive 48 or clicked all the final nodes,"not really, i learned from the practice and tried to use what I learned. but i flet towards the end i was losing some clicking more noes after finding a positive 48 so i would chance it.",no,as in knew knowledge? that Mturk task can be fun.,very fun!,42
111,On negative nodules,"If the end nodule had a decent $ amount, that was where I took the spider",Bottom left,I figured 24 was enough for me. ,"I settled for 24 most times, because I didn't think it was worth chasing to see if there was a 48","No, it was easy",I don't know,,33
112,When the negative number was high,I just clicked randomly ,I don't know ,When i was satisfied with the number ,no ,no ,To look at all my choices before making a choice,,26
113,I checked the nodes first,I checked the nodes first to see what would be more profitable,the upper node on the left side,The arrows stopped me,Apparently it wasn't good because I didn't even hit $1000,Not sure,I learned that I needed to try to follow the highest money ,,44
114,If I saw a negative score in that region.,Based on the score of the last node.,No I was not more willing to click at the beginning. ,After I had made up my mind about the node I wanted.,I was able to decipher which route would result in the best outcome for me.,No!,How to make the right choice based on using a proper strategy. ,Thank you!,29
115,i didn't click if i already found the highest number,the end values,the end points,when i found the highest number,n/a,no,how to check,n/a,32
116,i tried to go left if i kept getting negative on the first two nodes,"whichever way I went if i won more money, i went back and click the opposite. ",took turns,the game stopped it,nothing really,no,2 negatives seemed to get me a 3rd negative,,49
117,The nodes on the path towards negative nodes,The last nodes that you would land on first,The last nodes in the sequence,When I found a positive 48,Click on ending nodes until you find 48,No,You have to determine how much you want to spend on clicks in order to lower risk,,21
118,Trial and error,It was random until the last 4 stages when I kind of figured it out.,Most likely to my right.,I didn't,It was a learn as you go method,"Yes, the entire game until the end.",I should have gone to the left more often,It was a fun game after you figured the method.,46
