The ad.html has a very specific format.

Really there are two "ads" contained within this file.

The first ad displays to participants who are browsing
the Amazon Mechanical Turk site but have not yet accepted
your hit.

The second part of the ad display after the person selected
"Accept HIT" on the Amazon website.  This will reload the
ad and will display a button which, when clicked, will pop
open a new browser window pointed at your local psiTurk
server (assuming it is running and accessible to the Internet).

See comments throughout for hints

       <h1>Call for participants</h1>
       <p>The Computational Cognitive Science Group at the University
           of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley) is looking for online
           participants for a brief experiment on how people make decisions.</p>

           <p>This HIT takes about 30 minutes. You will play an airplane flight simulation game for 20 rounds. You will decide where to fly your plane in order to maximize earnings. This pays $1.50 plus a performance bonus of up to $5.00.</p>

               <p>The requirements are:</p>

               <ul>
                  <li>You are at least 18 years old,</li>
                  <li>You have normal vision or wear corrective lenses, and</li>
                  <li>You are a fluent English speaker.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>Note: the experiment will only work in recent browsers, and
               may have difficulty loading on slower connections.</p>

               <div class="alert alert-warning">
                 <strong>This task can only be completed once.</strong>
                 If you have already completed this task before the system will not
                 allow you to run again. If this looks familiar please return the
                 HIT so someone else can participate.
             </div>
             <p>
                 Otherwise, please click the "Accept HIT" button on the Amazon site

     If assignmentid is NOT "ASSIGNMENT_ID_NOT_AVAILABLE"

     You should thus show them instructions to begin the
     experiment ... usually a button to launch a new browser
     window pointed at your server.

                 It is important you do not change the code for the
